# *Instagram Clone*

**Instagram Clone* is a photo sharing app similar to Instagram but using Parse as its backend.

## User Stories

- [x] User can view the last 20 posts submitted to "Instagram".
- [x] The user should switch between different tabs - viewing all posts (feed view), compose (capture photos form camera) and profile tabs (posts made) using fragments and a Bottom Navigation View. (2 points)
- [x] User can pull to refresh the last 20 posts submitted to "Instagram".
- [x] User sees app icon in home screen and styled bottom navigation view
- [x] Style the feed to look like the real Instagram feed.

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

Adjusting how to use refresh for this application took a bit of brain power especially because we weren't guided on it and it was slightly different from how we did it before.

## Notes

Working with the camera was a bit difficult because of how much it took resource wise to run on the emulator. Made running, testing, and debugging the app extremely difficult.
